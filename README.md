## Course Summary

### Course Objective
Most phenomena in nature, medicine, science, business, and engineering are measured at certain time moments that are often non-homogeneous. Extracting information from such series poses a great challenge for analysts, as standard techniques are mostly developed for evenly distributed time series without prominent noise. This course aims to explain the theoretical and practical core of time series analysis with these disadvantageous characteristics.

### Learning Outcomes
Students will be trained for effective analysis of noisy time series that are unevenly distributed in time. This skill is applicable in the sciences, medicine, business, engineering, as well as in the analysis of social network time series and sociological research.
